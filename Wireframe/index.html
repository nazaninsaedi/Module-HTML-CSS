            <p class="article-summary">By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git.
              Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds,
              the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
              A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, 
              including commercial projects as well as open source. 
              Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of
              available software development
              talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</p>

                <h2 class="article-heading"> What is branch in GIT ?</h2>
                <p class="article-summary">Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.
                  When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.
              
                  You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.
              
                  Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!</p>
